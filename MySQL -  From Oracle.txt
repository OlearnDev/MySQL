----------------- Installing MySQL from Downloaded Packages

Download and install packages using the following commands:

	On RPM-based systems, including Oracle Linux, Red Hat, Fedora, and CentOS:  

		rpm -ivh packagename.rpm
	
	On APT-based systems, including Ubuntu and Debian:

		dpkg -i packagename.deb
		
		•
For Debian installation : 

	DEB packages are available for APT Linux systems, either individually or bundled.
	
	$sudo dpkg -i mysql-{common,community-client,client, community-server,server} *.deb


For automatic installation : 

	On RPM-based systems, including Oracle Linux, Red Hat, Fedora, and CentOS, use yum install.

		yum install mysql-community-server
		yum install mysql-workbench

	On APT-based systems, including Ubuntu and Debian, use apt-get install:

		apt-get install mysql-community-server
		apt-get install mysql-workbench

	• Installing the mysql-community-server packages also installs the packages for the components the server requires.

(See file 1.Installing MySQL 5.7  on Debian)



************  Adding Yum  Repository

• Download the Yum repository RPM file from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/yum/.

	- Choose the correct RPM for your distribution.
	- Example: The "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 / Oracle Linux 7 (Architecture Independent), RPM Package" is called  mysql80-community-release-el7-3.noarch.rpm
	
	- Install the file by using the yum localinstall command, for example:

		$ yum localinstall mysql80-community-release-el7-3.noarch.rpm

	- The preceding command adds the MySQL Yum repository to the host''s Yum configuration.

• Enable or disable specific versions.
	- MySQL 8.0 is enabled by default. Other versions are disabled.

• Run "yum install <packagename>" to install a package from the new repository.


************  Configuring Yum Repository Versions

• Enable or disable specific versions by editing the /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community-repo file
• The latest Generally Available (GA) version is enabled by default.

The following extract shows the MySQL 5.7 repository is disabled:

	# Enable to use MySQL 5.7
	[mysql57-community]
	name=MySQL 5.7 Community Server
	baseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.7-community/el/7/$basearch/
	enabled=0
	gpgcheck=1
	gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql


To enable the MySQL 5.7 repository, change the value of the enabled setting so that it reads enabled=1.	

When you start the service for the first time using :
	service mysqld start or 
	systemctl start mysqld
	

************  Adding an APT Repository

Download the APT repository DEB file from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/apt/.

Supported distributions:
	Debian version 9
	Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04, and 18.04 and 18.10

Install the file by using the dpkg command:

	$dpkg -i mysql-apt-config 0.8.12-1_all.deb     <---- Opens an interactive window to select version to install

The preceding command adds the MySQL APT repository to the host''s APT configuration.

• Configure the repository versions.
• Run apt-get update to refresh the repository metadata.
• Run apt-get install packagename to install a package from the new repository.

*********** Manually Configuring the APT Repositories

Enable or disable specific repositories by editing

/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list:

• Performing the steps in the preceding slide results in the following configuration:

	### THIS FILE IS AUTOMATICALLY CONFIGURED ###

	#You may comment out entries below, but any other modifications may be lost.
	# Use command 'dpkg-reconfigure mysql-apt-config' as root for modifications.

	deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/ubuntu/bionic mysql-apt-config
	deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/ubuntu/ bionic mysql-8.0
	deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/ubuntu/ bionic mysql-tools

	#deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/ubuntu/ bionic mysql-tools- preview
	deb-src http://repo.mysql.com/apt/ubuntu/ bionic mysql-8.0

• Enable or disable a specific product repository by uncommenting or commenting its line,respectively	
	

*************** Installing MySQL on Windows

• MySQL Installer:

	Is distributed as an .msi executable
	Guides you through a configuration wizard to create the folders and configuration required to run MySQL

• Noinstall Archive:

	Is distributed as a .zip file
	Must be unpacked and moved to the desired installation location
	Must be manually configured to create the folders and configuration required to run MySQL
		

Installing MySQL as a Windows Service

	• With MySQL Installer:

		- Use the provided service name or select an alternative.

	• At the command line after installation:

		- Install the service manually:
			mysqld.exe --install servicename  -- defaults-file="C:\my.ini"

		- Remove an installed service:
			mysqld.exe --remove servicename

	• View the installed services by using the Services control panel application.

		- Launch from the command line:
			services.msc

	Set services to start automatically or manually and provide a Windows account withwhich to start the service


************   Installing MySQL from Source

Build MySQL from the source code when you need to:

	• Configure compiled-in options

		- Examples:
			- Disabling unused features on production servers with well-understood use cases to maximize performance
			- Enabling additional debugging features

	• Run MySQL on a platform for which there are no precompiled binaries
	• Add your own modifications (or community patches) to MySQL


************ Installing MySQL from Binary Archive

If you do not install from a package manager, you must perform some configuration steps manually.

1.Create the mysql user and group.

	# groupadd mysql
	# useradd -r -g mysql -s /bin/false mysql		<--- Adds a user with no home and no pwd

2.Extract the archive to a suitable directory while logged in as mysql. 
	- Alternatively, change the ownership of the extracted archive to mysql after extracting it.

	# mkdir /usr/local/mysql-8.0.x/
	# chown mysql:mysql /usr/local/mysql-8.0.x/
	# cd /usr/local/mysql-8.0.x/
	# tar xf ~/mysql-8.0.x-linux-glibc2.12-x86_64.tar.gz

3. Create the initial configuration file.

	- Copy my-default.cnfto/etc/my.cnf.
	- Edit the datadir setting to point to the data directory.
	- Edit the basedir setting to point to the installation directory.
	- Edit any other required settings:
		+ Log file settings
		+ TCP port

4. Initialize the data directory and note the generated temporary password:

	# bin/mysqld --initialize --user=mysql

5. Start the MySQL Server.

	# bin/mysqld safe --user=mysql &

6. Connect to the MySQL server using the temporary password.

	# mysql -u root -p

	Enter password: (enter the random password)

	mysql>

7. Change the root user password.

	mysql> ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'new password';

8. Optionally, populate time zone tables.

	Example:

	# mysql_tzinfo to sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root mysql -p


***********  Deploying MySQL Server with Docker

You need to install the Docker engine and client on your host machine first.

1. Download a MySQL Server Docker image.
	- Using the MySQL Community Edition image
		- Log in to Docker Hub and pull the image using the docker command:

			# docker pull mysql/mysql-server

	- Using the MySQL Enterprise Edition image
		- Log in to My Oracle Support and download the MySQL Commercial Server Docker Image
		- Load the image using the docker command:

		# docker load -i mysql-enterprise-server-version.tar

2. List all the downloaded images.

		$ docker images
			
			REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID   CREATED   SIZE

		$vi /etc/resolv.conf 			<---- Added the lines to be able to reach docker repo
		
			nameserver 8.8.8.8
			nameserver 8.8.4.4
			nameserver 127.0.0.53
		
		$ docker pull mysql:latest

		mysql        latest    56a8c14e1404   8 weeks ago   603MB
		

3. Create a MySQL Server Docker container:

	# docker run --name=mysql1 -d mysql/mysql-server

4. View the MySQL server logs:

	# docker logs mysql1

Retrieve the generated temporary password:

	# docker logs mysqll 2>&1 | grep GENERATED

5. Connect to the MySQL server from within the container:

	# docker exec -it mysql1 mysql -uroot -p	
		Enter the temporary password
		Change the root user password:

	mysql> ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY 'new password';
	
	
	

Demo :

$ docker run --name=mysql1 -d mysql/mysql-server

----- mysqld: MySQL Server Process

• Launched automatically by one of the server helper programs
	- Including operating system startup scripts

• Launched manually to debug the MySQL server configuration
	- The error messages go to the terminal by default rather than to the error log.
	- Example:
		$ mysqld --user=mysql --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock


Installation Programs

• mysql_secure_installation:

	- Security program that enables initial secure configuration

• mysql_tzinfo_to_sql:

	- Utility that creates a SQL script containing the host''s time zone information

• mysql_upgrade:

	- Program that verifies database contents and ensures that they are compatible with the current version of MySQL
	- Deprecated since MySQL Server 8.0.16 where the tasks are performed automatically when the server starts up

---------- Utility Programs

	• mysql_config_editor (auto login): Manages login paths to simplify how you connect command-line clients to the MySQL server
	• mysqlbinlog (for recovery): Reads and replays the contents of the binary log
	• mysqldumpslow (slow queries): Reads and summarizes the contents of the slow query log
	• mysql_ssl_rsa_setup : Creates TLS keys and certificates
	• ibd2sdi : Extracts serialized dictionary information (SDI) from InnoDB tablespace files  (replaces frm files ??)


mysql_config_editor : Useful for different mysql envs you want to login

	Use mysql_config_editor to create encrypted option files.

	• Store user, password, and host options in a dedicated option file:

		-	.mylogin.cnf in the current user''s home directory
		-	To specify an alternative file name, set the MYSQL_TEST_LOGIN_FILE environment variable.

	• The .mylogin.cnf file contains login paths.

		- They are similar to option groups.
		- Each login path contains authentication information for a single identity.
		- Clients refer to a login path with the --login-path (or -L) command-line option:

		# mysql --login-path=admin [or -L=admin]

		- Protect the file from being read by other users. Anyone who can read the file can use the credentials and is able to obtain the plain text passwords.

.mylogin.cnf Format  ----------------------------------------

• The decrypted.mylogin.cnf file consists of option groups.

	- Similar to other option files

• Each option group in .mylogin.cnf is a login path.

	- A set of values indicating the server host and the credentials for authenticating with that server
	- Permits only a limited set of options (user, password, and host)

• 	Example:

	[admin]
	user = root
	password = oracle
	host = 127.0.0.1

Login Paths ----------------------------------------

	• To create a login path:

		mysql_config_editor set --login-path=login-path --user=username --password 	--host=hostname

	• To view a single login path in clear text:

		mysql_config_editor print 	--login-path=login-path

	• To view all login paths in clear text:

		mysql_config_editor print --all

	• To remove a login path:

		mysql_config_editor  remove --login-path=login-path

	• The default login path name is [client]. It is read by all standard clients.


Command-Line Client Programs   ----------------------------------------

	• mysql: MySQL command-line client
	• mysqladmin: Utility for monitoring, administering, and shutting down MySQL
	• mysqldump/mysqlpump: Backup utilities that create SQL scripts to restore the structure and contents of databases
	• mysqlimport: Utility for importing the contents of delimited data files
	• mysqlslap: Load emulation client
	• mysqlshow: Utility for displaying database object metadata
	• mysqlcheck: Utility for checking and optimizing tables
	• mysqlsh: MySQL Shell is an advanced command-line client and code editor for MySQL Server.



--=============  STARTING AND STOPPING MYSQL ============================

Methods of starting MySQL:

	+ Run the mysqld binary directly.
	+ Run "mysqld_safe".
	+ Use the Linux service manager
		- Run "service mysqld start" on SysVInit systems.
		- Run "systemctl start mysqld" on systemd.

Methods of stopping MySQL:

	+ Kill the "mysqld" binary with the "SIGTERM" signal (-15).
		Kill "mysqld_safe" first if it is running.

	+ Use the Linux service manager
		- Run "service mysqld stop" on SysVInit systems.
		- Run "systemctl stop mysqld" on systemd.

	+ mysqladmin shutdown						<----- We can use mysqladmin to shutdown but not to start the service. mysqladmin is used when db is up
	+ SQL "SHUTDOWN" statement


Stopping MySQL with mysqladmin ---------------------------------

+ Using the [client] login path:

	$ mysqladmin shutdown

+ Using the [admin] login path:

	$ mysqladmin --login-path=admin shutdown

+ Providing credentials and server connections at the command line:

	$ mysqladmin -u root -p -h dbhost -P 3306 shutdown     <----- 3306 is mysql default port

	Enter password: password
	
	
MySQL Service Files		---------------------------------

• On SysVInit systems, copy the mysql.server script to /etc/init.d/mysqld.

	Some package installers create this file automatically.
	Call it with start, stop, or restart options.
	Examples:

		service mysqld start
		/etc/init.d/mysqld restart
		support-files/mysql.server stop

• When you install MySQL from an RPM package built for systemd distributions or if you have configured systemd manually, use the "systemctl" command:

	systemctl start mysqld
	systemctl stop mysqld

	This uses the mysqld.service file, which is a systemd service unit configuration file


• On Windows

	+ Run the server process directly.

		mysqld.exe

	+ If you have installed MySQL as a Windows service:

		- An automatic service starts when Windows starts
		- Start and stop services manually from the Services control panel application Launched from the Start Menu or with the services.msccommand
		- Start and stop services manually from the command line with the net or sc commands:

			net start servicename
			sc start servicename
			net stop servicename
			sc stop servicename


• MySQL Notifier : 

	+ Installed by MySQL Installer
	+ Automatically registers MySQL services on the local machine
	+ Enables registration of remote MySQL services
	+ Displays the running status of registered servers
		- Displayed in the system tray
		- Optionally, notifies when a registered server changes status or when MySQL Notifier detects a new local MySQL service

	+ Enables starting, restarting, and stopping registered servers
	+ Launches installed MySQL applications:
		- MySQL Workbench
		- MySQL Utilities
		- MySQL Installer


Upgrading MySQL		---------------------------------

	+ The easiest upgrade is between minor versions within the same series.
		Example: Upgrading from 8.0.xx to 8.0.yy

	+ You can upgrade from MySQL 5.7 to 8.0
		- Only between General Availability (GA) releases, MySQL 5.7.9, or later
		- Oracle recommends upgrading to the latest 5.7 GA release before upgrading to MySQL 8.0.

	+ Be aware of differences between the versions so that you can choose the correct upgrade method (in-place or logical) and avoid compatibility problems.
	+ Even if you are performing an in-place upgrade, you should back up your data beforehand.
		- This enables you to roll back the upgrade if you encounter problems.

Reading Release Notes :

Before you upgrade, view the changes between your existing version and the target version:

	• For MySQL 8.0, use the following URL:
		https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/upgrading-from-previous-series.html

	• For previous versions, replace 8.0 in the URL. For example, MySQL 5.7:
		https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/upgrading-from-previous-series.html

	• You may want to view the release notes for the changes between the minor versions.
		https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/index.html

	• Look for the following headings, which denote changes that you might need to handle before you upgrade:
		Known Issue
		Incompatible Change
		etc


MySQL Shell Upgrade Checker Utility 	---------------------------------

• The util.checkForServerUpgrade() function:

	Is available in MySQL Shell
	Enables you to verify whether MySQL server instances are ready for upgrade
	Checks for compatibility errors and issues for upgrade to MySQL 8.0
	Supports only MySQL Server 5.7 and 8.0 General Availability (GA) releases
	Checks the configuration file (my.cnf or my. ini) if you provide the file path

• The version of MySQL Shell must be the same or later than the version of MySQL Server to which you are upgrading.
• The following example checks a MySQL server for upgrade to release 8.0.18:
	mysqlsh --util checkForServerUpgrade user@localhost:3306 --target-version=8.0.18 --config-path=/etc/mysql/my.cnf


Using In-Place Upgrade Method   	---------------------------------

Use the in-place (physical) upgrade method when you upgrade within a series or from one major version to the next.

	- Stop the MySQL server process.
	- Use file copy to back up the current databases. (Optional, but recommended)
	- Replace the mysqld binary with the new version.
	- Start the MySQL server process using the new binary.
	- Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, you must run mysql upgrade. In MySQL 8.0.16 and higher, the server restart will perform all the upgrade tasks automatically.

This is the recommended method to upgrade from MySQL 5.7 to 8.0.

Using Logical Upgrade Method   	---------------------------------

• Use the logical (backup/restore) upgrade method when you upgrade to one or more later major versions.
	- Use mysqldump to back up the current databases.
	- Install and initialize a new MySQL server.
	- Start the new MySQL server.
	- Restore the backed-up databases from the dump file.
		- May result in errors due to incompatibilities introduced by new, changed, deprecated, or removed features and capabilities

• Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, you must run mysql_upgrade. In MySQL 8.0.16 and higher, you must shut down the server and restart it with 
		the --upgrade=FORCE option to perform the remaining upgrade tasks.
		
		
mysql_upgrade :

	- Checks all tables in your databases for incompatibilities with current versions of the MySQL server
	- Repairs any problems found in tables with possible incompatibilities
	- Upgrades system tables to add any new privileges or capabilities that are available in the new version
	- Marks all checked and repaired tables with the current MySQL version number
	- Not required for MySQL server 8.0.16 or later. The server will perform all the upgrade processes during startup. 
	    A new option --upgrade is introduced in 8.0.16 to control the upgrade process.



Demo 1 : Installing MySQL ---------------------------------


1. Extract the MySQL 5.7 binary archive from /stage/MySQL-Server/mysql-advanced- 5.7.*.tar.gz to/opt.

	# cd /opt
	# tar xf /stage/MySQL-Server/mysql-advanced-5.7*.tar.gz

2. Create a symbolic link from the newly extracted MySQL directory to '/usr/local/mysql'.

	Enter the following command at the Linux terminal prompt:

	# ln -s /opt/mysql* /usr/local/mysql

When you install a new version of MySQL in the practice titled "Upgrading MySQL," you replace this symbolic link with a link to the new 
version's directory without overwriting the existing version's directory.

3. View the contents of the '/usr/local/mysql/bin' directory.

	# ls /usr/local/mysql/bin
		
4. Add/usr/local/mysql/bin to the root user''s executable search path :

	$vi .bashrc
	
	....
	export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin to the ~/.bashrc file. 

5. Apply your changes to the ~/.bashrc file by executing the Linux source command.

	# source ~/.bashrc

6. Copy the/labs/my.cnf file to/etc/my.cnf.

	# cp  /labs/my.cnf  /etc/my.cnf

	- Some Linux distributions include a /etc/my.cnf. The Oracle Linux version used in classroom environments does not.

7. View the contents of the /etc/my.cnf file.

	Open the /etc/my.cnf file 

		$ vi /etc/my.cnf
		
			[mysqld]
			datadir = /var/lib/mysql
			socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
			user = mysql

			# Disabling symbolic-links is recommended to prevent assorted security risks
			symbolic-links-0

			[mysqld_safe]
			log-error = /var/log/mysqld.log 
			pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
		
		EOF
		
NB : The options in the /etc/my.cnf file specify the following:

	- The data directory is in /var/lib/mysql.
	- The socket file is in the data directory.
	- The process runs as the mysql user.
	- When you launch MySQL via mysqld_safe, the server logs errors in the /var/log/mysqld. log file, and the PID file is in the /var/run/mysqld directory.
	- The default base directory (not amended in /etc/my.cnf) is /usr/local/mysql.

8. The mysql user does not as yet exist on the host machine. Create it as a system user by executing the adduser-r command.

	# adduser -r mysql

NB : The -r switch creates a system user that has no password, that does not expire, and that has no home directory. It also creates a group with the same name.

9. Initialize the data directory by executing mysqld-initialize and note the temporary password that appears.

	# mysqld --initialize
	
		.....
		<date-and-time> 0 (Warning) CA certificate ca.pem is self signed.
		<date-and-time> 1 [Note] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost: 3C_Va/o*88DP
		
The '--initialize' command-line option creates a new data directory in /var/lib/mysql owned by the mysql user and group, using the settings in the /etc/my.cnf
 file. The new data dir contains the initial InnoDB System Tablespace, system databases and SSL encryption keys and certificates. A default root pwd is created
 very useful for 1st connexion

10. The pid-file option refers to the /var/run/mysqld directory, which does not as yet exis. Create that directory and grant its ownership to the mysql user 
and group.

	# mkdir /var/run/mysqld
	# chown mysql:mysql /var/run/mysqld/

11. Launch MySQL by executing the mysqld_safe script.

	# mysqld_safe &

MySQL is now running.

Demo 2 : Connecting to MySQL ---------------------------------

1. The /etc/my.cnf file does not as yet contain an option group that configures the client. Add a [client] option group that contains the same socket value 
	as the value contained in the [mysqld] option group.

	[client]
	socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

2. Launch the mysql command-line client, logging in as the root user with the temporary password that you noted in the preceding practice.

	# mysql -uroot -p

	Enter password: 3C_Va/o*88DP

	Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with or \g.
	Your MySQL connection id is 2
	Server version: 5.7.28-enterprise-commercial-advanced
	...
	mysql> 
	
3. Attempt to change the current database to mysql and note the error message that appears.

	mysql> USE mysql

	ERROR 1820 (HY000): You must reset your password using ALTER USER statement before executing this statement.
	
4. Change the MySQL root password to oracle.

	mysql> ALTER USER USER () IDENTIFIED BY 'oracle';

	Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.44 sec)

- The USER () function returns the current user''s full account name (in this case, root@localhost) and provides a useful way to identify 
	the current user without typing out the full account name.

5. Log out of the mysql client.

mysql> EXIT

6. Log in again, this time providing the new password.

	$ mysql -uroot -p

	Enter password: oracle

	Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with or \g.

	Your MySQL connection id is 3

	mysql>

	- MySQL accepts the new password.

7. Attempt to change the current database to mysql and note any differences in behavior from step 3.

	mysql> USE mysql

	Database changed

	mysql>

	- The command changes the default database successfully. When you change the initial temporary password, it re-enables the account.
	out of the mysql client.

	mysql> EXIT

Demo 3 : Configuring MySQL service	---------------------------------

1. Stop the MySQL server by executing an appropriate mysqladmin command.

	$ mysqladmin -uroot -p shutdown

	Enter password: oracle

2. Inspect the contents of the/labs/service/mysql-5.7/mysqld.service file. This is the service unit configuration file.

# cat/labs/service-5.7/mysqld.service

	[Unit]
	Description-MySQL Server
	Documentation man=mysqld (8)
	Documentation-http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/using-systemd.html
	After=network.target
	After=syslog.target

	[Install]
	WantedBy-multi-user.target

	[Service]
	User=mysql
	Group=mysql

	Type=forking

	PIDFile=/usr/local/mysql/data/mysqld.pid

	# Disable service start and stop timeout logic of systemd for mysqld service.

	TimeoutSec=0

	#Start main service

	ExecStart=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld --defaults-file=/etc/my.cnf --daemonize --pid-file=/usr/local/mysql/data/mysqld.pid $MYSQLD_OPTS

	#Use this to switch malloc implementation
	EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/mysql

	#Sets open files_limit
	LimitNOFILE = 5000

	Restart=on-failure

	RestartPreventExitStatus=1

	PrivateTmp=false
	
	EOF	
	
3. Copy the 'mysqld.service' file to the '/usr/lib/systemd/system' directory.

	$ cp  /labs/service-5.7/mysqld.service /usr/lib/systemd/system

4. Enter a systemctl command that enables the mysqld service to start automatically when the host machine reboots.

	$ systemctl enable mysqld.service

		Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mysqld.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/mysqld.service.

5. Enter a systemctl command that starts the mysqld service.

	$ systemctl start mysqld	
	

Demo 4 : Upgrading MySQL service	---------------------------------

1. Install 'MySQL.Shell' from the RPM file in the /stage/MySQL-Shell directory.

	# cd/stage/MySQL-Shell
	# rpm -i mysql-shell-commercial-8*.rpm

	warning: mysql-shell-commercial-8.0.18-1.1.el7.x86 64.rpm: Header V3 DSA/SHAL Signature, key ID 5072e1f5: NOKEY

2. Run mysqlsh to perform a check for upgrade using the following command:

	# mysqlsh root@localhost --util checkForServerUpgrade

		Please provide the password for 'root@localhost': oracle
		Save password for 'root@localhost'? [Y]es/[N]o/Ne [v]er (default No): [press Enter)
		.....

3. Enter a systemctl command that stops the running mysqld service.

	# systemctl stop mysqld

4. Verify that the mysqld service is not running.

	# systemctl status mysqld

		mysqld.service MySQL Server
		Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/mysqld.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
		Active: inactive (dead) since
		....

5. Extract the MySQL Server 8.0 commercial edition binary archive from/stage/MySQL-Server to /opt.

	# cd /opt
	# tar xf /stage/MySQL-Server/mysql-commercial-8*.tar.gz

6. List the contents of the /opt directory to verify that both versions of MySQL server are installed.

	# ls /opt

		mysql-advanced-5.7.28-e17-x86_64
		mysql-commercial-8.0.18-e17-x86_64

	- The exact version numbers might be different on your machine. However, there should be a 5.7 and 8.0 version, and both must be general availability (GA)
		releases.

7. Remove the symbolic link to/usr/local/mysql, which you created in the practice titled "Installing MySQL." It links to the directory that contains 
	the older version of the MySQL server and is no longer required.

	$ rm / usr/local/mysql

		rm: remove symbolic link '/usr/local/mysql'? y

8. Create a symbolic link from the newly extracted MySQL directory to /usr/local/mysql.

	$ ln -s /opt/mysql-commercial-8* /usr/local/mysql

9. Replace the existing mysqld.service file in the /usr/lib/systemd/system directory with the /labs/service-8.0/mysqld.service file.

	# cp /labs/service-8.0/mysqld.service /usr/lib/systemd/system

10. Execute systemctl daemon-reload to make systemd aware of the new service unit configuration file.

	# systemctl daemon-reload

11. Start the mysqld service to launch the new version of the server.

	$ systemctl start mysqld

12. verify that the mysqid service is running.

	$ systemctl status mysqld

13. Run mysql_upgrade to complete the upgrade process and ensure that there are no incompatibilities between the versions. Is this step required? 

	$ mysql_upgrade -uroot -P

		Enter password: oracle
		
	- This step is not required because MySQL server 8.0.16 or later will perform all of the upgrade process automatically when you start the server.

If you are upgrading to an older release before 8.0.16. you may see the following result:

	$ mysql_upgrade -uroot -p

		Enter password: oracle

		Checking if update is needed.
		Checking server version.
		Running queries to upgrade MySQL server.
		Upgrading system table data.
		Checking system database.
		mysql.columns_priv 	O.K.
		mysql.component		O.K.
		mysql.db			O.K.
		mysql.default_roles	O.K.
		mysql.engine_cost	O.K.
		....

14. Use systemctl to view the full logs during the startup of the MySQL server. Can you find the logs related to the upgrade process?

	$ systemctl status mysqld
	
15. Verify that the new version of MySQL server is now running on your system.

	$ mysqld --version

		/opt/mysql-commercial-8.0.18-e17-x86_64/bin/mysqld Ver 8.0.18- commercial for el? on x86 64 (MySQL Enterprise Server - Commercial)


		
Demo 5 : Deploying MySQL with Docker	---------------------------------

1. Load the MySQL Enterprise Server Docker image into your Docker Engine and verify the image has been loaded successfully.

	$ cd/stage/MySQL-Server/
	$ docker load i mysql-enterprise-server-8.0.18.tar

		4fee40bcfecf: Loading layer 124.2MB/124.2MB
		570b2c36673a: Loading layer 305MB/305MB
		85211a73c61b: Loading layer 8.704kB/8.704kB
		1cf11301afd2: Loading layer 2.048kB/2.048kB
		Loaded image: mysql/enterprise-server: 8.0

	$ docker images

		REPOSITORY				TAG 	IMAGE ID 			CREATED 		SIZE
		mysql/enterprise-server	8.0		216a5e9c5del		4 weeks ago		421MB

	- The image name is mysql/enterprise-server and the tag is 8.0.

2. Start a MySQL Server Docker container with the name mysql1 using the MySQL server image. Check that the container is running.

	$ docker run --name-mysqll -d mysql/enterprise-server:8.0

		0917d09d8ff01b231407be0b37dab218ab0902047e549f3b429a2c83f7e83ac2

	$ docker ps

		CONTAINER ID 	IMAGE							COMMAND					CREATED 						STATUS 		PORTS 				NAMES
		0917d09d8fEO 	mysql/enterprise-server: 8.0	"/entrypoint.sh mysq." 	28 seconds ago	Up 28 seconds	(healthy)	3306/tcp, 33060/tcp	mysql1

3. Retrieve the generated root password for the mysqll container.

	$ docker logs mysqll 2>&1 | grep GENERATED

		[Entrypoint] GENERATED ROOT PASSWORD: SOMALASpuG, EbzOh@qIkJ3xEKm3

4. Execute a mysql command-line client from the mysql1 container to connect to the MySQL server running in the container. Enter the generated password 
	to authenticate the connection.

	# docker exec it mysqll mysql -uroot -p

		Enter password: SOMALASpuG, Ebzoh@qIkJ3zEKm3

	mysql>

5. Change the root user password with an ALTER USER statement and exit the mysql command-line client.

	mysql> ALTER USER USER () IDENTIFIED BY 'MySQL8.0';
	mysql> EXIT

6. Execute a mysql command-line client from the mysql1 container to connect to the MySQL server running in the container. Enter the new password. 
	Then exit the mysql command- client.

	# docker exec -it mysqli mysql -uroot -p

	Enter password: MySQL8.0

	mysql> EXIT
	
7. Stop the MySQL server by stopping the Docker container and verify the status of the container.

	$ docker stop mysql1

		mysql1

	$ docker ps -a

	CONTAINER ID 	IMAGE 							COMMAND  				 CREATED   	 		STATUS						  	PORTS	 	NAMES
	0917d09d8ff0	mysql/enterprise-server: 8.0	"/entrypoint.sh mysq..." About 4 minutes ago Exited (0) About a minute ago 			mysql1

8. Start the MySQL Server Docker container and verify the status of the container.

	$ docker start mysql1
		mysqll

	# docker ps

	CONTAINER ID 	IMAGE 							COMMAND  				CREATED   	 						STATUS	  		PORTS	 		NAMES
	0917d09d8ff0 	mysql/enterprise-server: 8.0 	"/entrypoint.sh mysq..." About 11 minutes ago Up 34 seconds	(healthy) 3306/tcp, 33060/tcp 	mysql1

9. Stop the MySQL Server Docker container.

	$ docker stop mysqll
		mysql1


---========== CHAP.3 : UNDERSTANDING MYSQL ARCHITECTURE ==========================

Architecture   ---------------------------------

	A MySQL installation has the following architectural components:

		The MySQL server process
		Client programs connecting locally or remotely
		Other MySQL programs (that are not clients) installed locally

	Client programs connect to the MySQL server process to make data requests.

MySQL Server Process :

	- Is a program called mysqld
	- Runs as a single process that is multithreaded
	- Manages access to databases on disk and in memory
	- Supports simultaneous client connections
	- Supports multiple storage engines
	- Supports both transactional and non-transactional tables
	- Optimizes memory usage by using caches and buffers

Terminology			--------------------------------------------------------

Host: The physical machine or virtual machine on which the server program runs, which includes the following:
		Its hardware configuration
		The operating system running on the machine
		Its network addresses

MySQL server software: A software program (mysqld) with a version number and a list of features
MySQL server instance: A mysqld server process that manages a data directory containing one or more schemas
	- Multiple instances can run on a single host.

Connection Protocols --------------------------------------------------------

	Protocols are implemented in the client libraries and drivers.
	The speed of a connection protocol varies with the local settings.
	In addition to the legacy MySQL Classic Protocol, the MySQL X Protocol is introduced in MySQL 5.7.12 and enabled by default in MySQL 8.0.

Protocol		Connection		Supports					Operating Systems	

TCP/IP			Local, remote 	Classic and X Protocol		All
Socket file		Local			Classic and X Protocol		UNIX-derived operating systems including Linux, BSD, Max OS X
Shared memory	Local			Classic Protocol			Windows
Named pipes		Local			Classic Protocol			Windows



Local and Remote Connection Protocol: TCP/IP --------------------------------------------------------

• TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):

	- Is the suite of connection protocols used to connect hosts on the Internet		
		+ Uses IP addresses or DNS host names to identify hosts
		+ Uses TCP port numbers to identify specific services on each host
		+ MySQL default TCP port number:

			3306 for MySQL Classic protocol (server port option)
			33060 for MySQL X Protocol (server mysqlx port option)
			33062 for administrative connection using MySQL Classic protocol (server admin port option)

    - Enables connections between different hosts

• Example using a host name and the default port (no option specified):

	$ mysql --host=mysqlhost1 --user=root --password

• Example using an IP address and an alternative port (use the -P or --port option):

	$ mysql -h 192.168.1.8 -P 3309 -uroot -p



Local Connection Protocol in Linux: Socket  --------------------------------------------------------

• A form of inter-process communication

	- Used to form one end of a bidirectional communication link between two processes on the same machine

• Requires that the server creates a socket file on the local system with the 'socket' and 'mysqlx_socket' options for MySQL classic and X Protocol, respectively
	- The client specifies the socket file with the option --socket or -s when it connects.
	- This is the best connection type for Linux.

• Example using the /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock socket file:

	$ mysql -S /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock -uroot -p

• Example using the default socket file /tmp/mysql.sock:

	$ mysql -uroot -p
	
	- If no host is specified, mysql assumes -h localhost.

------- [ Note sur Socket ] ----------------------------

socket est un fichier socket Unix. Sur une plate-forme de type Unix, le client dispose de deux manières de se connecter au serveur MySQL, 
à savoir la méthode TCP/IP et la méthode du fichier socket. 
Les connexions de fichiers socket Unix sont plus rapides que TCP/IP, mais ne peuvent être utilisées que pour se connecter à un serveur sur le même ordinateur
Le chemin et le nom du fichier socket peuvent être configurés en définissant la variable socket. La valeur par défaut est /tmp/mysql.sock

------- [ Fin Note ] ------------------------------------

MySQL and localhost :

• MySQL assumes the TCP protocol when you specify --host=hostname except when the host name is localhost.
	- If the host name is localhost, MySQL assumes you are connecting using a UNIX socket.

• To connect to the localhost IP address 127.0.0.1 or ::1 (for IPv6):
	- Specify TCP explicitly:

		$ mysql -h localhost --protocol=tcp -uroot -p

	- Specify the localhost IP address explicitly:

		$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -uroot -p
		$ mysql -h::1 -uroot -p

Local Connection Protocols in Windows: 

• With Shared memory:

The server creates a named shared memory block. Client processes running on the same host uses the shared memory to communicate with the server.
Shared memory is disabled by default. Example of using the default shared memory base name MYSQL:

	$ mysql --protocol=memory -uroot -p

• With Named pipes:

	In Windows, named pipes work much like UNIX sockets:
		The server creates the named pipe, and the client writes to it and reads from it.

	Named pipes support read/write operations, along with an explicit passive mode for server applications.

	Example: $ mysql --protocol=PIPE -uroot -p    <-----  A vérifier



SSL by Default   --------------------------------------------------------

For TCP/IP connections, the connection layer uses secure, encrypted connections when they are available.

	• MySQL package installers create SSL keys if OpenSSL is installed on the server host.
		- The installer calls the mysql_ssl_rsa_setup utility to create the keys.
		- If you install from a binary archive, call this utility manually.

	• MySQL clients use SSL if keys are available.
		- Keys are in the data directory.
		- Copy client keys to remote clients to enable encrypted remote connections.

	• If SSL is not available, connections are unencrypted.
		- You can configure the server and clients to use SSL mandatorily.

	• SSL is not supported on socket, named pipe, and shared memory connections but only supported in TCP mode


Connection Threads	  --------------------------------------------------------

•	The server creates a connection thread for each active client connection.
	- All statements executed by that client are executed by a single server thread.
	- The server destroys the thread when the client disconnects.

•	The Thread Pool plugin manages connections and server threads separately:
	- Manages client connections with thread groups
	- Each thread group allows only one short-running statement at any point in time.
		Reduces the number of server threads
		A thread group can create additional server threads for long-running statements.

	- Distinguishes between high-priority and low-priority statements based on their transaction membership
		Statements within a running transaction are high priority.
		Long-running transactions are improved.
		
•	X DevAPI supports connection pooling, where the client can maintain a pool of connexions for reuse

Quiz :

Which of the following parameters to the --protocol option works on all operating systems, both locally and remotely?

	a. PIPE
	b. MEMORY
	C. SOCKET
	d. TCP  *


SQL Layer ----------------------

SQL Layer Components

After a connection is established, MySQL processes each query in the SQL layer, which comprises the following components:

	+ Parser: Validates the query''s syntax and semantics and converts it to a standard form
	+ Authorization: Verifies that the connected user is allowed to run the query and has enough permissions on the objects the query refers to
	+ Optimizer: Creates an optimal execution plan for each query. This involves deciding which indexes to use and in which order to process the tables
	+ Query execution: Fulfills the execution plan for each query
	+ Query logging: Logs queries that the server receives or executes
