		rpm -ivh packagename.rpm
	
	On APT-based systems, including Ubuntu and Debian:

		dpkg -i packagename.deb
		
		•
For Debian installation : 

	DEB packages are available for APT Linux systems, either individually or bundled.
	
	$sudo dpkg -i mysql-{common,community-client,client, community-server,server} *.deb


For automatic installation : 

	On RPM-based systems, including Oracle Linux, Red Hat, Fedora, and CentOS, use yum install.

		yum install mysql-community-server
		yum install mysql-workbench

	On APT-based systems, including Ubuntu and Debian, use apt-get install:
